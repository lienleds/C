### 3. Bootloaders

#### Common Bootloaders

Here are some widely used bootloaders:

- **GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)**  
    A versatile bootloader that supports multiple operating systems and offers extensive configurability.

- **LILO (Linux Loader)**  
    A simpler, legacy bootloader primarily used in older Linux systems.

- **U-Boot**  
    A popular choice for embedded systems due to its flexibility and support for various architectures.

- **CFE (Common Firmware Environment)**  
    A lightweight bootloader designed for Broadcom-based embedded systems.

- **SYSLINUX**  
    Well-suited for booting from removable media like USB drives and CDs.

- **Coreboot**  
    An open-source firmware replacement for BIOS/UEFI, focusing on speed and customization.

- **PXELINUX**  
    Enables network booting using the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE).

### Exercises

Test your understanding of bootloaders with these exercises:

1. **Implement inter-process communication (IPC)**  
     Use mechanisms such as shared memory and message queues.

2. **Create and manage processes**  
     Utilize Linux system calls to create and manage processes.

3. **Configure and test GRUB**  
     Set up GRUB on a virtual machine to understand its configuration and functionality.

4. **Use U-Boot for embedded systems**  
     Boot a Linux kernel on an embedded device and explore U-Boot's configuration options.

5. **Investigate Coreboot**  
     Compare its boot time with traditional BIOS/UEFI implementations.
