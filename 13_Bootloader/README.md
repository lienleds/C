# Bootloaders

Bootloaders are essential software components that initialize the operating system (OS) during the boot process. They are responsible for loading the kernel and transferring control to it. This document provides an overview of various bootloaders and related technologies.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **BIOS**
- Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process.

### 2. **UEFI**
- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a modern replacement for BIOS with advanced features like secure boot.

### 3. **MBR**
- Master Boot Record (MBR) is a partitioning scheme used in legacy systems.

### 4. **GPT**
- GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a modern partitioning scheme that supports larger disks and more partitions.

### 5. **GRUB**
- GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a popular bootloader for Linux systems.

### 6. **LILO**
- LILO (Linux Loader) is an older bootloader for Linux systems.

### 7. **SYSLINUX**
- SYSLINUX is a lightweight bootloader for Linux, often used for booting from removable media.

### 8. **PXELINUX**
- PXELINUX is a variant of SYSLINUX designed for network booting using PXE.

### 9. **U-Boot**
- U-Boot (Universal Bootloader) is a bootloader commonly used in embedded systems.

### 10. **Coreboot**
- Coreboot is an open-source firmware designed to replace proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware.

### 11. **CFE**
- Common Firmware Environment (CFE) is a bootloader used in embedded systems.

### 12. **SPI**
- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a communication protocol often used for accessing firmware stored on flash memory.

## Missing Topics

### 13. **Secure Boot**
- Secure Boot is a UEFI feature that ensures only trusted software is loaded during the boot process.

### 14. **Bootloader Security**
- Discusses techniques for securing bootloaders, including password protection and encryption.

### 15. **Chainloading**
- Chainloading is the process of loading one bootloader from another, often used in dual-boot setups.

### 16. **Bootloader Development**
- Covers the basics of writing a custom bootloader, including assembly and C programming techniques.

### 17. **Redundant Bootloaders**
- Explains the use of redundant bootloaders for high-availability systems.

### 18. **Bootloader Debugging**
- Techniques and tools for debugging bootloader issues, such as serial consoles and JTAG.
