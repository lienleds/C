# CFE (Common Firmware Environment)

CFE is a lightweight bootloader designed for embedded systems, particularly those using Broadcom chipsets. It is responsible for initializing hardware and loading the operating system kernel.

## Key Features
- **Hardware Initialization**: Initializes CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Provides a simple CLI for debugging and configuration.
- **Network Booting**: Supports TFTP for remote kernel loading.
- **Customization**: Can be tailored for specific hardware platforms.

## CFE Workflow

1. **Power-On**:
   - CFE is executed from firmware storage (e.g., flash memory).

2. **Hardware Initialization**:
   - Initializes hardware components like CPU and memory.

3. **Boot Options**:
   - Offers options to load the kernel from local storage or over the network.

4. **Kernel Loading**:
   - Loads the kernel into memory and transfers control to it.

## CFE Commands

- **Boot the OS**:
  ```bash
  boot
  ```

- **Load a Kernel via TFTP**:
  ```bash
  load -tftp -addr=0x80000000 kernel.img
  ```

- **Flash a New Firmware**:
  ```bash
  flash -noheader : flash0.kernel
  ```

## Exercises

1. Use CFE to load a kernel via TFTP on an embedded device.
2. Explore the CFE command-line interface and experiment with its commands.
3. Compare CFE with other bootloaders like U-Boot and GRUB in terms of features and use cases.
4. Investigate the customization options available for CFE on specific hardware platforms.
