# Bootloader Development

Bootloader development involves creating a custom bootloader to initialize hardware and load the operating system. This requires knowledge of low-level programming and system architecture.

## Key Concepts
- **Assembly Language**: Used for low-level hardware initialization.
- **C Programming**: Used for higher-level bootloader logic.
- **BIOS/UEFI**: Interfaces for interacting with firmware.

## Steps
1. Initialize hardware (CPU, memory, peripherals).
2. Load the operating system kernel into memory.
3. Transfer control to the OS kernel.

## Tools
- **QEMU**: Emulator for testing bootloaders.
- **GCC**: Compiler for building bootloader code.
- **GDB**: Debugger for troubleshooting.
