# Redundant Bootloaders

Redundant bootloaders are used in high-availability systems to ensure that the system can still boot even if the primary bootloader fails.

## How It Works
- Multiple bootloaders are installed on different storage devices.
- If the primary bootloader fails, the system automatically switches to the secondary bootloader.

## Benefits
- Increases system reliability.
- Reduces downtime in critical systems.

## Use Cases
- Servers and data centers.
- Embedded systems.
- Mission-critical applications.
