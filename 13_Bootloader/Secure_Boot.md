# Secure Boot

Secure Boot is a UEFI feature that ensures only trusted software is loaded during the boot process. It is designed to prevent unauthorized or malicious code from running during system startup.

## Key Features
- Verifies the digital signature of bootloaders and OS kernels.
- Ensures that only trusted software is executed.
- Protects against rootkits and bootkits.

## How It Works
1. The firmware checks the digital signature of the bootloader.
2. If the signature is valid, the bootloader is executed.
3. The bootloader then verifies the OS kernel and other components.

## Benefits
- Enhances system security.
- Prevents unauthorized modifications to the boot process.
- Ensures compliance with security standards.

## Challenges
- Requires proper key management.
- May cause issues with dual-boot setups.
