# Bootloader Debugging

Bootloader debugging involves identifying and resolving issues in the bootloader code. This is a critical step in bootloader development and maintenance.

## Techniques
- **Serial Console**: Use a serial connection to view debug messages.
- **JTAG**: Hardware debugging interface for low-level debugging.
- **Logging**: Add debug logs to the bootloader code.
- **Emulators**: Use tools like QEMU to test the bootloader in a virtual environment.

## Tools
- **GDB**: Debugger for analyzing bootloader code.
- **QEMU**: Emulator for testing bootloaders.
- **Oscilloscope**: For analyzing hardware signals.

## Best Practices
- Test the bootloader in a controlled environment.
- Use version control to track changes.
- Document all debugging steps and findings.
