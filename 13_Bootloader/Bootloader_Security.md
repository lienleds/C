# Bootloader Security

Bootloader security involves techniques to protect the bootloader from unauthorized access and tampering. A secure bootloader ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the system.

## Techniques
- **Password Protection**: Requires a password to access bootloader settings.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the bootloader and its configuration files.
- **Secure Boot**: Verifies the digital signature of the bootloader.
- **Access Control**: Restricts access to bootloader settings.

## Best Practices
- Use strong passwords.
- Regularly update the bootloader to patch vulnerabilities.
- Enable Secure Boot if supported.
- Monitor and log bootloader access attempts.
