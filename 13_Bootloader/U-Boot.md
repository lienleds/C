# U-Boot (Universal Bootloader)

U-Boot is a versatile and widely used bootloader, particularly in embedded systems. It supports a variety of architectures and provides extensive configurability for hardware initialization and kernel loading.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with multiple architectures, including ARM, x86, and PowerPC.
- **Hardware Initialization**: Initializes CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- **Network Booting**: Supports TFTP and other protocols for loading kernels over a network.
- **Scripting Support**: Allows automation of boot processes using scripts.
- **Extensibility**: Highly customizable for specific hardware platforms.

## U-Boot Workflow

1. **Stage 1: Power-On and Hardware Initialization**
   - U-Boot initializes the hardware, including CPU, memory, and peripherals.

2. **Stage 2: Load Kernel or Bootloader**
   - U-Boot loads the operating system kernel or a secondary bootloader from storage (e.g., SD card, NAND flash).

3. **Stage 3: Transfer Control**
   - U-Boot transfers control to the kernel, which initializes the system.

## U-Boot Commands

- **Access U-Boot Console**:
  Connect to the device via a serial connection to access the U-Boot command-line interface.

- **Load Kernel via TFTP**:
  ```bash
  tftpboot 0x80000000 uImage
  ```

- **Boot the Kernel**:
  ```bash
  bootm 0x80000000
  ```

- **List Available Commands**:
  ```bash
  help
  ```

## U-Boot Configuration

U-Boot can be configured using environment variables. These variables define the boot process and can be saved to persistent storage.

### Example U-Boot Environment Variables
```bash
setenv bootcmd 'tftpboot 0x80000000 uImage; bootm 0x80000000'
setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.100
setenv serverip 192.168.1.1
saveenv
```

## Exercises

1. Access the U-Boot console on an embedded device and explore its commands.
2. Configure U-Boot to load a kernel image from an SD card.
3. Set up a TFTP server and use U-Boot to load a kernel over the network.
4. Create a custom U-Boot script to automate the boot process.
5. Compare U-Boot with other bootloaders like GRUB and LILO in terms of flexibility and use cases.
