# QEMU (Quick Emulator)

QEMU is a powerful open-source emulator and virtualizer that allows users to run operating systems and programs for one machine on a different machine. It is widely used for virtualization, system emulation, and testing.

## Key Features
- **Full System Emulation**: Emulates an entire system, including CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- **User-Mode Emulation**: Runs programs compiled for one architecture on another architecture.
- **Virtualization**: Uses hardware acceleration (e.g., KVM) for near-native performance.
- **Snapshot Support**: Allows saving and restoring the state of a virtual machine.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Suitable for embedded systems, OS development, and testing.

## QEMU Workflow

1. **Install QEMU**:
   - Install QEMU on your system using the package manager.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install qemu qemu-kvm
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Disk**:
   - Create a virtual disk image to store the guest operating system.
   ```bash
   qemu-img create -f qcow2 mydisk.qcow2 10G
   ```

3. **Boot a Virtual Machine**:
   - Boot a virtual machine using an ISO image.
   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -hda mydisk.qcow2 -cdrom myos.iso -boot d -m 1024
   ```

4. **Use Snapshots**:
   - Save the state of the virtual machine.
   ```bash
   qemu-img snapshot -c snapshot_name mydisk.qcow2
   ```
   - Restore the state of the virtual machine.
   ```bash
   qemu-img snapshot -a snapshot_name mydisk.qcow2
   ```

## Advantages of QEMU

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various host operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Wide Architecture Support**: Supports multiple CPU architectures, such as x86, ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC.
- **Open Source**: Actively developed and supported by the community.
- **Integration with KVM**: Provides hardware-accelerated virtualization for better performance.

## Exercises

1. Install QEMU on your system and create a virtual machine to run a Linux distribution.
2. Experiment with QEMU's snapshot feature to save and restore the state of a virtual machine.
3. Use QEMU to emulate a different CPU architecture and run a program compiled for that architecture.
4. Compare the performance of QEMU with and without KVM acceleration.
