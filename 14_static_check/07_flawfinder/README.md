# Flawfinder

Flawfinder is a static analysis tool designed to find potential security vulnerabilities in C and C++ source code. It focuses on identifying common programming flaws that could lead to security issues.

## Key Features
- **Security Analysis**: Detects potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and race conditions.
- **CWE Mapping**: Maps findings to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple command-line interface.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to adjust the reporting level and exclude specific files or directories.
- **Open Source**: Free and open-source tool.

## Installation

### On Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flawfinder
```

### On macOS
```bash
brew install flawfinder
```

### From Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/flawfinder.git
   ```
2. Install the tool:
   ```bash
   cd flawfinder
   sudo python3 setup.py install
   ```

## Usage
To analyze a C or C++ file, use the following command:
```bash
flawfinder your_code.c
```

### Common Options
- `--minlevel=N`: Sets the minimum risk level to report (1-5).
- `--columns`: Displays column numbers in the output.
- `--dataonly`: Reports only data-related issues.
- `--html`: Outputs results in HTML format.
- `--quiet`: Suppresses informational messages.

### Example
Consider the following C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "This is too long");
    return 0;
}
```
Run Flawfinder:
```bash
flawfinder example.c
```
Output:
```
example.c:5:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination.
  Use strncpy or strlcpy instead.
```

## Integration with CI/CD
Flawfinder can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate security checks. Use the CLI commands to include it in your build process.

## Best Practices
- Run Flawfinder regularly to identify potential security issues.
- Use `--minlevel` to focus on high-risk vulnerabilities.
- Combine Flawfinder with other tools like SonarQube and Coverity for comprehensive analysis.
- Address findings promptly to improve code security.
