# Parasoft C/C++test

Parasoft C/C++test is a comprehensive static and dynamic analysis tool for C and C++ code. It is designed to improve code quality, ensure compliance with industry standards, and detect security vulnerabilities.

## Key Features
- **Static Analysis**: Detects coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Identifies runtime issues like memory leaks and concurrency problems.
- **Unit Testing**: Automates the creation and execution of unit tests.
- **Code Coverage**: Measures the extent of code tested during unit and integration testing.
- **Compliance**: Supports standards like MISRA, CERT, ISO 26262, and DO-178C.
- **IDE Integration**: Works with popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Eclipse, and CLion.

## Installation
Parasoft C/C++test is a commercial tool and requires a license. Follow these steps to install it:

1. **Download**: Obtain the installer from the [Parasoft website](https://www.parasoft.com/products/ctest/).
2. **Install**: Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. **License**: Activate the tool using your license key.

## Usage
Parasoft C/C++test can be used for both static and dynamic analysis. Below are the typical workflows:

### Static Analysis
1. Configure the analysis settings in the Parasoft GUI or CLI.
2. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   cpptestcli -config "path/to/config" -source "path/to/source" -report "path/to/report"
   ```
3. Review the generated report for issues.

### Dynamic Analysis
1. Instrument the code for runtime analysis.
2. Execute the instrumented code.
3. Analyze the runtime data using the Parasoft GUI or CLI.

### Unit Testing
1. Generate unit test stubs:
   ```bash
   cpptestcli -generateTests -source "path/to/source"
   ```
2. Implement the test cases.
3. Run the tests and review the results.

## Example Workflow
1. Run static analysis on your project:
   ```bash
   cpptestcli -config "MISRA" -source "src/" -report "reports/"
   ```
2. Generate unit test stubs:
   ```bash
   cpptestcli -generateTests -source "src/"
   ```
3. Measure code coverage:
   ```bash
   cpptestcli -coverage -source "src/" -report "coverage/"
   ```

## Integration with CI/CD
Parasoft C/C++test integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. Use the CLI commands to automate analysis and testing in your pipeline.

## Best Practices
- Run static analysis regularly to catch issues early.
- Use dynamic analysis to identify runtime problems.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards by using the appropriate configurations.
- Combine Parasoft C/C++test with other tools like Valgrind and Coverity for comprehensive analysis.
