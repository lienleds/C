# MISRA Checkers

MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) Checkers are tools designed to enforce the MISRA C and MISRA C++ coding standards. These standards are widely used in safety-critical industries like automotive, aerospace, and medical devices to ensure code reliability, safety, and maintainability.

## Key Features
- **Coding Standards Compliance**: Enforces MISRA C and MISRA C++ guidelines.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies violations of MISRA rules, including safety-critical issues.
- **Customizability**: Allows configuration to enforce project-specific rules.
- **Integration**: Works with popular IDEs, build systems, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed compliance reports.

## Installation and Setup
The installation process depends on the specific MISRA checker tool. Refer to the documentation of the chosen tool for detailed instructions.

## Example Workflow
1. **Select a MISRA Checker**: Choose a tool that fits your project requirements.
2. **Configure the Tool**: Enable MISRA rules in the configuration file.
3. **Analyze the Code**: Run the tool on your source code.
   ```bash
   lint-nt -i"path/to/misra.cfg" your_code.c
   ```
4. **Review the Report**: Address violations and ensure compliance.

## Best Practices
- Use MISRA checkers early in the development process to catch issues early.
- Regularly analyze code to maintain compliance.
- Combine MISRA checkers with other tools like Valgrind and SonarQube for comprehensive analysis.
- Train your team on MISRA guidelines to improve code quality.
