# PC-Lint/FlexeLint

PC-Lint and FlexeLint are static analysis tools for C and C++ code. They are designed to detect programming errors, enforce coding standards, and improve code quality. PC-Lint is used on Windows, while FlexeLint is its cross-platform counterpart.

## Key Features
- **Error Detection**: Identifies syntax errors, logical bugs, and undefined behavior.
- **Coding Standards**: Supports MISRA, CERT, and other coding standards.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to define custom rules and configurations.
- **Integration**: Works with popular IDEs and build systems.
- **Cross-Platform**: FlexeLint supports Linux, macOS, and other platforms.

## Installation
PC-Lint/FlexeLint is a commercial tool and requires a license. Follow these steps to install it:

1. **Download**: Obtain the installer from the [Gimpel Software website](https://www.gimpel.com/).
2. **Install**: Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. **License**: Activate the tool using your license key.

## Usage
PC-Lint/FlexeLint analyzes source files and generates detailed reports. Below are the typical workflows:

### Basic Analysis
Run the tool on a source file:
```bash
lint-nt -i"path/to/config" your_code.c
```

### Using a Configuration File
Create a configuration file (e.g., `lint.cfg`) to specify rules and options:
```cfg
// Example lint.cfg
+e123  // Enable specific warning
-e456  // Disable specific warning
-w3    // Set warning level
```
Run the tool with the configuration file:
```bash
lint-nt -i"path/to/lint.cfg" your_code.c
```

### Example
Consider the following C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "This is too long");
    return 0;
}
```
Run PC-Lint/FlexeLint:
```bash
lint-nt example.c
```
Output:
```
example.c(6): Warning 123: Possible buffer overflow in call to strcpy
```

## Integration with Build Systems
PC-Lint/FlexeLint can be integrated into build systems like Makefiles and CI/CD pipelines. Use the CLI commands to include it in your build process.

## Best Practices
- Run PC-Lint/FlexeLint regularly to maintain code quality.
- Use configuration files to enforce project-specific rules.
- Address warnings and errors promptly to prevent technical debt.
- Combine PC-Lint/FlexeLint with other tools like SonarQube and Coverity for comprehensive analysis.
